This is an ionic dummy project to showcase a native scrolling bug on iOS. When an input field loses focus, the content goes white. Same behaviour may also be seen when the input is originally focused for the first time.

Bug is reproducible on devices with smaller screens like the iPhone 4 and 5.

Bellow you can see a few demos of the bug - tested on iPhone 5:
